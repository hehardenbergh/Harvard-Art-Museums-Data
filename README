#Artwork Activity at the Fogg Museum#
##Harvard University##
For GOV 1005, Final Project

This Shiny App looks at possible correlations between artist's nationalities and the amount of times an object is requested for viewing in the first-floor Modern and Contemporary Art galleries.

## Findings




##Data Information

You can also look at Harvard's objects and get detailed descriptions here: https://www.harvardartmuseums.org. The museum also has a complete API, which houses interesting data on how users interact with the website, how often objects are catalogued in different storage sites, and how often they are brought into the museum galleries for exhibition. The API can be found here: https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs
